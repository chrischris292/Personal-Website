During the summer, I was involved in an software developer internship related to Systems Biology. I worked on creating a Javascript library used to simulate a chemical reaction encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). The library engineers a system of first-order ordinary differential equations and utilizes the Dormand-Price Method to evaluate the ODE.
