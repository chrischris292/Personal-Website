				          <h2>Baseball Sabermetrics Project</h2>
				          <p>The project idea came to me after I saw the movie Moneyball. I had a fantasy baseball draft coming up with some friends and needed a way to rank players based off of statistical analysis that no one else could see. Sabermetrics analytics, created by statisticians and economists such as Bill James, often charge a premium to view on websites such as fan graphs. As a financially constrained college student, I had to find alternatives.  </p>
						  <p>This project utilizes PHP, mySQL, HTML, Javascript, and Sean Lehman's Baseball database to implement statistical analysis in Major League Baseball. </p>

						          <h2>Benjamin Graham Intrinsic Valuation</h2>
						          <p>On the side of computer engineering, I have a great interest in finance. Since the 10th grade, I have managed investment portfolios such as Scottrade and Investopedia. As of August 28, 2013, my Investopedia portfolio stands at 84.69% positive. As a swimmer, I enjoy competiion and bettering myself. In order to improve my investopment portfolio, I needed a method to evaluate stocks in a different setting than already existed i.e. Google and Yahoo Finance; Benjamin Graham's stock valuation formula was a perfect way to do so. </p>
								  <p>This project utlizes YQL, HTML, Javascript, charts.js, jquery.js</p>

									            <h2>Systems Biology Markup Language Project</h2>
									            <p>During the summer, I was involved in an software developer internship related to Systems Biology. I worked on creating a Javascript library used to simulate a chemical reaction encoded in the Systems Biology Markup Language (SBML). The library engineers a system of first-order ordinary differential equations and utilizes the Dormand-Price Method to evaluate the ODE. This project is open source. There exists programs offered in Matlab and other programming languages on the SBML website, but none in a web-based format.
