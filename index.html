       	On May 18th, 2013, while visiting friends from back home, I sat in a Computer Science course at the University of Washington. This class was a web development course, CSE 154. The lecture was over Javascript and PHP.  <blockquote class = "pull-right">

       	In a span of a little more than 50 minutes I had discovered a new hobby. It was the first time I had ever become interested in programming. A few weeks and many course lectures later, I took two research internship positions with the Communications and Systems Biology departments at the University of Washington. Four months and many open/closed sourced projects later I was hired as a Systems Engineering intern at the Dow Chemical Company.

       		The project idea came to me after I saw the movie Moneyball. I had a fantasy baseball draft coming up with some friends and needed a way to rank players based off of statistical analysis that no one else could see. Sabermetrics analytics, created by statisticians and economists such as Bill James, often charge a premium to view on websites such as fan graphs. As a financially constrained college student, I had to find alternatives.<br />

       		This project utilizes PHP, mySQL, HTML, Javascript, and Sean Lehman's Baseball database to implement statistical analysis in Major League Baseball.

On the side of computer engineering, I have a great interest in finance. Since the 10th grade, I have managed investment portfolios such as Scottrade and Investopedia. As of August 28, 2013, my Investopedia portfolio stands at 84.69% positive. As a swimmer, I enjoy competiion and bettering myself. In order to improve my investopment portfolio, I needed a method to evaluate stocks in a different setting than already existed i.e. Google and Yahoo Finance; Benjamin Graham's stock valuation formula was a perfect way to do so.<br />

This project utlizes YQL, HTML, Javascript, charts.js, jquery.js
